# üå≥ Unified Productivity and Knowledge Forest App üå≥

A unique application that blends productivity tools with a dynamic forest visualization to represent learning and task progress.

---

## Inspiration

The **Unified Productivity and Knowledge Forest App** was inspired by the idea of gamifying productivity and learning. The forest visualization creates an engaging and rewarding experience by visually representing knowledge growth and task completion.

---

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, track, and mark tasks as complete.
- **Knowledge Forest Visualization**: Watch your forest grow as you add subjects and topics, with trees dynamically representing your learning progress.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Securely store and persist your tasks and forest data.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Trees grow taller and denser as you add more topics.

---

## How It Works

1. **Task Management**:
   - Add tasks categorized by topics like "AI," "Careers," or "Distributed Systems."
   - Set due dates and estimated time for each task.
   - Mark tasks as completed or delete them as needed.

2. **Knowledge Forest**:
   - Add subjects and topics to grow your personalized Knowledge Forest.
   - Subjects are represented as trees, and topics contribute to their growth.

3. **Persistent Storage**:
   - Data is securely stored in MongoDB Atlas, ensuring your progress is never lost.

4. **Visual Engagement**:
   - The forest grows dynamically, providing a visual representation of your knowledge.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: For secure and scalable database storage.
- **Pygame**: For rendering the dynamic forest visualization.
- **Pandas**: For managing task data.
- **Python**: For core application logic.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+**
2. **MongoDB Atlas** account or local MongoDB instance.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/forest-of-knowledge.git
cd forest-of-knowledge
```

### Step 2: Create a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following content:

```plaintext
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<dbname>` with your MongoDB credentials.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

Start the Streamlit app with:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## Usage

### Task Management

1. Navigate to the **Task Management** section.
2. Add tasks by entering details such as category, task name, estimated time, and due date.
3. Track progress and mark tasks as completed.

### Knowledge Forest

1. Add a new subject to start your forest.
2. Add topics under each subject to watch your forest grow dynamically.
3. Visualize your progress in real time.
